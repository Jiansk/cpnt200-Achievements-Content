# Project title: 
- Pizza Paint

##Project description: 
 
 As an artist who is gonna be making his own art website soon, i would lovingly design my future app or website to be just like the Artstation app where it has optional tutorial pages, channels(whether the user wants to learn anatomy, draw anime and manga, character designs, portrait painting, environmental concept art and design, or fan arts) but for this project im going to make my app just like the minimized version of artstation where the potential user can browse through the art shop. Each art pieces is going to have a name, their own description, a price, a date when the piece was created, an information whether the piece is made traditionaly or digitaly and a display image of the art piece. My website will also have a contact page where you can put your full name, emails, additional message and a link to my facebook, instagram, and probably youtube if im going to have tutorial videos in the future. The app will also have an about page of the artist talking about how he started his website, how he came into this direction and how he discovered his talents.
